 *     (the "Agreement").
 *   1.2 The provisions of these UAF CLT shall govern the relationship between the Customer and Unicorn regarding
 *     the UAF License granted under the Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in case of any conflict between these
 *     UAF CLT and the Agreement, the provisions of the Agreement always prevail.

 *     Application Framework, which are listed and described in the Attachment I to these UAF CLT.
 *   1.4 "UAF" shall mean the Unicorn Application Framework the scope of which is described in Attachment I, including all
 *     associated documentation and preparatory design materials, in particular blueprints, models, user manuals,
 *     training materials, comprehensive instructions and guidelines for drafting, production, operation and maintenance of
 *     software solutions, reference architecture, ready-made components and tools, use cases and tutorials.
 *   1.5 The "Knowledge Base" shall mean the online materials, internet fora and other resources made available by Unicorn
 *     online with regard to the UAF, intended for the broad customer and developer community.

 *     UAF Components or its other parts, further specified in the Agreement.
 * 2. LICENSE GRANT
 *   2.1 The Customer shall be hereby granted a non-exclusive and non-transferable worldwide license to use the UAF for
 *     the purpose of the Solution described in the Agreement. For this purpose, the Customer shall be entitled to modify
 *     the UAF and create derivative works based on the UAF.
 *   2.2 The Customer is entitled to grant third parties a sub-license allowing them to use the UAF or any derivative works
 *     based on the UAF under commercial terms of its choice, provided that:
 *     2.2.1 use of the UAF and any derivative works based on the UAF by third parties is limited to testing, handover and
 *       operation of the Solution or its use as a service,
 *     2.2.2 third parties are not entitled to use the UAF or any derivative works based on the UAF independently of
 *       the Solution,
 *     2.2.3 third parties are not provided access to source code of the UAF unless such right is granted by the Agreement
 *       or if they conclude a commercial license agreement with Unicorn.
 *   2.3 The Solution or its parts based on the UAF shall bear a prominent copyright notice "Based on Unicorn Application
 *     Framework Copyright (c) Unicorn" integrated
 *     2.3.1 in the graphical user interface of the Solution or its relevant part or
 *     2.3.2 in accompanying file if the Solution or its relevant part do not have graphical user interface or
 *     2.3.3 in Solution's documentation.
 *   2.4 The License shall be valid for the whole duration of copyright to the UAF, unless other duration of the License is
 *     specified in the Agreement.
 *   2.5 The Customer is entitled to access the Knowledge Base only if expressly agreed in the Agreement.
 *   2.6 The Unicorn retains all rights to the UAF not covered by the provisions of this Clause 2. Unless explicitly
 *     permitted by applicable law, the Customer may not use the UAF in any other way than provided by the provisions of
 *     this Clause 2 and may not allow such use on its behalf by any of its employees or agents.
 *   2.7 The price for the License is included in the price stipulated in the Agreement.
 * 3. MODIFICATIONS
